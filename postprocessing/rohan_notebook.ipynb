She spent several years as a civilian analyst with the US Army Map Service, and then moved on to a successful career in real estate. Fondly known to friends and family as \"Ellie\", she was a force of nature. Her sharp intellect, which showed itself early on, did not diminish a beat before her last breath on Thursday, January 23, 2020 at the age of 88. Ellie\\'s quick mind was certainly matched by her sharp tongue, which anyone who talked politics with her surely experienced. And while she could be intensely serious, Ellie inherited her father Max\\'s \"twinkle in the eye\" and was quick to let out a girlish giggle at the drop of a good joke. While Ellie lived alone, she had a large circle of terrific friends with whom she always enjoyed an annual summer stay in Rehoboth Beach. Coming from a large extended family, she was adored by her many cousins, both young and old, who were frequently able to reunite with her and enjoy her company. Her life was lived on her own terms.

She cherished her sunroom at the farm, where she watched birds, admired flowers and guarded the holly tree from being trimmed. A life-long Washingtonian, she learned her favorite scriptures while attending National Cathedral School. Her tennis game was strong and perfected at Columbia Country Club. Janet\\'s degrees from Centenary College and American University prepared her to teach 1st grade, which thrilled her. She LOVED boys that were \"B.A.D.\" and delighted in every mischievous story they told. She adored being a mother to Buck/Frank (Frances), Lynne (Mike) and Blake - her favorite, according to him (Debbie), a grandmother to Tiffany McDougal, Lyndsay M Cannon (James), Ashleigh M Carlson (Chase), Hunter Patterson (Lori), Bryant Patterson, Jake Patterson, Colby Patterson and eight great-grandchildren - not bad for 87!\\xa0Gran Jan secured several gravesites in Rehoboth (lovingly referred to as The Ponderosa) and will be buried there during a private, gravesite ceremony. Celebration plans will follow. In the meantime, pour yourself a drink, raise a glass and say \"Cheers Gran Jan! We love you!\"'"

Daoud worked with the World Bank Group for almost 25 years, where he was Deputy General Counsel to the World Bank, and prior to that Deputy General Counsel to the International Finance Corporation. After the World Bank, he joined the law firm of White & Case. He also was an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, a member of the Beirut, Virginia, and DC Bar, a member of the Fairfax County Human Rights Commission, and served on the boards of several international organizations. His legal education includes License en Droit from the Lebanese University Law School, Beirut Lebanon; S.J.D., LL.M., and M.C.L. from The University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor. Daoud was the embodiment of his dual upbringing. The village life of Bhamdoun (Lebanon) planted in him deep traditional values, a steadfast sense of justice and an unwavering resilience in the face of challenges. America\\'s imprint on him was apparent in his faith in participatory politics, his disdain for passivity and his conviction that political change comes through reason and law. His lifelong focus was on fighting corruption. He authored two books and many articles and appeared on numerous TV programs on the subject. He loved Arabic poetry and music, was a gourmet, and an enthusiastic dabke dancer. He will be remembered both for his intellect and his love for life. He is dearly missed by family and friends. As current circumstances prevent holding a gathering, a website, (Daoud-khairallah.forevermissed.com) provides an online site for friends to share remembrances and comfort.'"

David grew up in Rochester, New York, but moved to Washington after law school and spent his entire career as counsel for various committees and subcommittees of the House of Representatives. He began and ended his career working for Rep. John Dingell, first as counsel to the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee and, finally, as Minority General Counsel on the Energy and Commerce Committee. David loved and excelled at the intellectual challenge and the public service that came with his chosen profession, but he especially loved the camaraderie of the people he worked with members and staffers on both sides of the aisle, many of whom became lifelong friends. David lived steps from where he worked on Capitol Hill, and his network of dear friends, many originally from the Hill community but also friends from nursery school (Temple Emanuel), high school (Irondequoit High), college (Williams College), and law school (Harvard) -- grew and grew. His annual parties to celebrate Opening Day of the Gin and Tonic Season became legendary even while becoming more sedentary family affairs as the crowd and their children grew up together. Family was central to David's life, and his loss is especially mourned by his brother Michael Schooler, his nieces Sarah Schooler and Debbie Schooler, their spouses Mary Busker and Andres Núñez, and his great-niece and great-nephews, Parker, Nicolai, Jackson, and Alexis, all of Washington D.C., along with a multitude of beloved cousins. A memorial gathering will have to await the lifting of the coronavirus restrictions. Meanwhile, in lieu of such a gathering and in lieu of flowers, the family suggests honoring Dave with a gin and tonic and a donation to a favorite charity assisting those in need or promoting social justice.\""

Growing up in Northern Virginia, Tom enjoyed family gatherings with his many cousins and aunts and uncles. He formed lifelong friendships at an early age, and added many close friends throughout his life. His three children remember him as a strong, loving father who encouraged them through example to investigate everything life had to offer, and inspired them to pursue their individual educational and personal aspirations. Family stories center around enjoyment of nature and camping, annual family reunion beach trips, music appreciation and performance, especially piano and guitar, and reading on diverse topics from philosophy to cosmology. Tom\\'s career was guided by his deep interest in science and medicine, coupled with his genuine compassion and his understanding of the suffering of others. He attended college at Catholic University of America, Washington, DC, (BS and MS, Engineering). He received his MD from George Washington University, Washington, DC, and completed residency training in psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. He then completed a research fellowship with NIMH\\'s Clinical Brain Disorders Branch before embarking on his career as a psychiatrist, with a sub-specialty in geriatric psychiatry. After 11 years in Atlanta, Georgia, first with Emory University and then in private practice, he accepted a position as an Attending Psychiatrist at Catawba Hospital, near Roanoke, VA. This move allowed Tom and Marguerite to realize their dream of living close to nature, and he enjoyed the peace and quiet that surrounded them there. Arrangements are being made by Paitsel Funeral Home, New Castle, VA. No service is planned at this time, but a celebration of Tom\\'s life will be held when circumstances allow.

Having lived most of her childhood above her parents corner grocery store in Wilmington DE, at 20, a girlfriend encouraged her to take the civil service exam in the hopes of them both landing a job with the federal government. Always the perfect student, Sylvia passed the exam (while unfortunately her friend did not), and thus began the relocation of her sisters, mother, and brother from Wilmington, DE to Washington, DC. She was most proud to have worked at the Department of Agriculture with Dr. William Sebrell, director of the National Nutrition Program, managing food production during the war years. She followed Dr. Sebrell to NIH when he was appointed director. No one was more honest than Sylvia and her family joked that she was likely the only person never to have taken even a pencil from the US Government. Sylvia remained civically engaged in her retirement, volunteering at the White House correspondence room and impressing upon her family to never, ever miss the opportunity to vote. The articles she clipped and sent to her grandchildren were about conflict resolution, international peacemaking, and strong female leaders. She also enjoyed gardening, bridge, traveling around the world, and visiting Washington's museums and cultural institutions. Most of all, Sylvia commented on how lucky she was to have a family full of kind, curious, loving, and successful children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces and nephews. They will all warmly remember being called Sweet Potato or Honey Bunch. In addition to her selflessness, integrity, and worldliness, her grandchildren hope to have inherited her trademark hair, which was beautifully thick and dark brown for her entire 100 years. Sylvia will be dearly missed.She is survived by her devoted children, sons David (Cindy Ferrara) and Alan (Sherri) Platt, her daughter Leslie (Howard) Stein; her adored grandchildren, Katherine (Phillip) Dickerson, Stephanie (Kris) Adams, Kimberly Platt, Tracy Platt (Jaret Washburn), Alexander (Julia) Stein, Taylor (Susannah) Stein, and Andrew Stein; and her precious great grandchildren, Eloise, Annabelle, Maren, and Eli. To honor her lifelong commitment to social justice, donations can be made to the Southern Poverty Law Center, or to a local food bank.\""

He was also, if we're going to be truthful here, dangerous at a barbeque unless you liked your food well-charred.

An avid farmer, lover of all things Western and a world traveler with friends throughout the world. But more than anything else he loved his wife, his children and his grandchildren.\\xa0His life was so full it almost defies belief and could fill many books, but for those who survive him, we will forever miss his being here in person.

Towery (Herndon, VA), his sisters Lynn Towery Courtenay (Madison, WI) and Anne Towery (Stan) Huber (Los Gatos, CA), as well as several nieces and nephews. Todd was first and foremost a lover of all things automotive and worked in that business his entire life, particularly as service advisor for many dealerships. He was an avid photographer whose passion showed in his racing photos. Nascar, Formula 1, 24-hour, motorcycles - it didn't matter: if they went fast on two or four wheels he captured them. Todd graduated from Louisville Country Day and the University of Louisville; he completed basic training at Ft. Knox as a member of the National Guard. Anyone who knew Todd as a teenager knew that he was a fun-loving scamp. He loved to drive fast and his BMW was his pride and joy. He enjoyed travel, exploring Europe on a motorcycle and touring Australia, New Zealand, and the western U.S. He attended races all over, especially at Daytona, and was always a huge fan of Dale Earnhardt. Todd was an eternal optimist and a wonderful storyteller with a great sense of humor, but he didn't suffer fools easily. He was a devoted reader of the Washington Post, a keen political observer, and a supporter of civil liberties. Todd lived a quiet life mostly on his own, but those who knew him will sorely miss him. Todd's family plans to celebrate his life at a later date when air travel is safer. Anyone wishing to honor his memory should consider contributing to a pro-environment cause or the ACLU.\""

       "\"Clifton, Chad Age 42 The life of Chad Joseph Clifton, age 42, was cut tragically short on Wednesday, May 27, 2020 when he passed away in his home in Washington D.C. Chad continues to live in the hearts of his wife Jelena and son Bodin; parents Patricia and John; his older sister Jacqueline Schad, brother-in-law, Jason, and his beloved nephew, Jeffrey; his relatives, and loving friends, whom he considered family. Chad leaves behind the memory of his great intellect and a unique wit, which were surpassed only by the immense love and loyalty to his dear ones. He was a humble and kind man described by many as the smartest guy in the room who would never make anyone feel less smart; the best friend in the times one needs best friends the most. Behind his boyish smile, there were tremendous determination and strength proven in multiple occasions in life. Chad was born in Tannersville, PA. He graduated cum laude from the Pocono Mt High School and continued education in Washington D.C. where he graduated from the honors program from the American University with the degree in international relations. Chad became a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, later rising to become the group's president. Majority of his career, including the final years, was spent working in the field of international development where he was running various governmental projects across Africa, Middle East and Europe. Chad was an avid Raiders' fan, music lover, poet, reader. But, above all else, Chad was a devoted husband and a wonderful father that would spend hours at the playground suiting to his little boy's every desire. His passing was mourned by the people from many different parts of the world, from his wife's native Montenegro to South Africa, UK, Iraq, Sudan, and other places where Chad lived and traveled. Thanks to all for their kind condolences and heartfelt tributes to Chad. Special thanks are due to Chad's friends William and Donna Reid, Kevin and Rachel Lawlor, Noah Steurer and Kathleen Doyle for their immeasurable support to Chad's family in these heart-breaking times. Chad's warm smile and kind heart will be forever missed and never forgotten.

Born in Chicago as an only child during the Depression to Czechoslovakian immigrants, Jan and Marie Hilgert, Vera began studying piano and violin at a young age, the foundation for launching a lifelong career in music. She juggled side jobs as a model and product spokesperson, including ads featured in Life magazine. She pursued her studies, first at University of Illinois and then Curtis Institute of Music, and finally American University, where she graduated cum laude with a Masters of Fine Arts.\\xa0Later, she began an almost 40 year career teaching students music (piano, violin and viola) in her Bethesda, MD home, which she shared with her (second) husband, Emil Dolezal, a Czechoslovakian immigrant and Olympic-bound heavy weight wrestler. They met at the Czechoslovakian embassy in DC after Emil defected to the USA from communist Czechoslovakia while competing in Vienna. The pair became well-known members of the Bethesda and Potomac, MD communities. Vera started a quartet group called The Potomac musicians. The group played at weddings, embassy events and other parties. Music was her passion. Vera and Emil started a plumbing business and a family with two children, Emile and Milana Dolezal. Vera maintained Hilgert family connections from Peru and Ecuador to what is now the Czech Republic. After becoming widowed, Vera supported her family with her music business, teaching in her living room and raising her children until they left for college. She created a strong family unit with her mother, who lived with them and was known affectionately to everyone as \"Babi\" (Czech for grandmother). Vera was cherished and will long be remembered by her family, music students, and friends for the twinkle in her eye, good-natured laugh, and taste for fine music and fine food, which she generously shared with everyone around her. Vera is survived by her good friend and cousin Dolores, her children Emile and Milana, along with two grandchildren, Alegra and Marlin, who also called her Babi. Funeral private.'"

Rosalie dabbled in meditation, writing, travel, Irish music and dance, gardening, hiking and trail maintenance, a writers group and the Academy of Lifelong Learning. Her final chapter landed her in a group of like-minded seniors who were outraged by today\\'s political and environmental crises. She gave generously of her time and limited money to do her part to address the issues she cared about. She \"marched for our lives\" after the Stoneman Douglas shootings, and participated in the Women\\'s Marches and others in DC. Her final protests led her to the Capitol to support the efforts of Jane Fonda\\'s Fire Drill Fridays even while undergoing difficult chemo treatment. Survived by two sisters, Catherine (the oldest) and Peggy (the youngest) and her children (Mike, Judy, Jo and Rita and their families), her last wishes were that we \"have a few laughs\" and plant some spring flowers.

She lost her husband when she was only 37 and never remarried. During her long life, spanning almost 97 years, Nezhat enjoyed traveling. She was particularly fond of Palm Beach, Florida, Maui, and New England. Nezhat enjoyed reading books and gardening, for which she had a profound love of nature. She was a very elegant woman, known for her great sense of fashion.She was a very spiritual person who prayed often. She was well known for her consistent affable manner, beautiful smile, kindness, and generosity. She was a philanthropist and tried to help people in need throughout her life.Nezhat, who was affectionately referred to as \"Lady Naderi\" by her family members, will be missed very much. Her family members include her granddaughter, Mrs. Bita Kiani, and grandson-in-law, Mr. Babak Kiani, and great grandson, Alexander Kiani, of McLean, VA; her grandsons Messrs. Arash and Ashkan Naderi, of Washington, DC; and her former daughter-in-law, Mrs. Mitra Pavlin and husband, Gregory, of Great Falls, Virginia.
